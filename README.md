**numberOfKeys**

- 12 colors have been set by default. In order to increase the `numberOfKeys` over 12, you need to create your own custom color scheme.

**colors**

- Pass in a custom color in the form of a hex code or named value.
- `colors` will use the last element to paint all *remaining* keys. For example, the following will paint the first key pink, and all remaining keys teal:

```js
colors={[
  {
    color: 'pink',
    colorPressed: 'grey',
    background: 'salmon'
  },
  {
    color: 'teal'
  }
]}
```

**pressedKey**:

- `pressedKey` allows you to pass in a function which can be used to determine which key was pressed most recently:

```js
const handleKeyPress = (number) => {
  ...
}

...

<Xylophone
  pressedKey={handleKeyPress}
/>
```

## Develop

Changes should *only* be made within the `./components` folder. The ES5 folder is the *compiled* equivalent. ES5 compiles Sass to CSS:

```
yarn compile-files
```

Install package locally via:

```
npm install path/to/this/folder
```
